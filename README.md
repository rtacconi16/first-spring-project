# First Spring Project

__What is Spring Boot?__

- Spring Boot is a comprehensive and modular opinionated framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.
- Spring's core feature is Inversion of Control (IoC) through Dependency Injection. It allows developers to manage and inject dependencies into their application components, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.
- Remove complexity and boilerplate code
- Data access easier to implement

**Why Spring?**

- Flexible, modular, and backwards compatible
- Makes components easier to test
- Rapid development
- Stand alone app 

**What is a repository?**

  When working with relational databases and JPA (Java Persistence API), you can use Spring Data JPA repositories. These repositories allow you to create database queries and perform common database operations using method names and query methods, without writing SQL queries explicitly.

**What is a controller?**

  Controllers are responsible for mapping incoming HTTP requests to specific methods or functions in your application code based on the request's URL and HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

  Controllers route traffic where it's supposed to go.

**What is a service?**

  Services encapsulate the business logic of an application. They contain methods that perform specific operations, manipulate data, and implement the core functionality of the application.

**What is a REST endpoint**

  A REST endpoint is a specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator) within a web service or web application that is used to access a particular resource or perform a specific action using the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST).
